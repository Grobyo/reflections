Q#8
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You can use a remote as a backup, use it when ther is more than one person working on the project, use it when you work on the project from more than 1 machine.
Q#9
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may be working on a experimental section or debugging a code section and you dont want that information getting updated or overwritten during the process.
Auto updating may be adding varaibles you dont want to deal with at the time.
Q #10
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork: Exists on Github only and allows you to make a copy of a repository of another user, which you can modify without impacting original repository
Clones: Creates a linked copy of a github repository whcih you can downlaod to your local machine and can then revise and uplaod as needed
Branch: creates a branch of an existing project in the sme repository which you can work on and merge as and when required.
